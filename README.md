# Version/Changelog #

* Bugfix: Missing comma in printf.
* Report first draft created.
* Bugfix: Mistaking precision for call and vice-versa.
* Added more debugging and renamed a variable.
* Bugfix: Input data frame to SVM needs to be sorted.
* Bugfix: calib is labeled B and not C.
* No need for pipes with R.
* Added more base cases. Accuracy increased.

## 0.5.0.0 [02-04-2014] #
* SVM Module now spits out the parameters of interest from the confusion
  matrix.
* Error messages will display the function name as well for debugging purposes.
* Created simplified SVM constructor function.
* Renamed for variables for consistency.
* Using hex for the table.
* body returns the empty container rather than just NULL.
* Pulled SVM tuner coder into a function.
* Fixed some bad comments.
* Bugfix: SVM now uses the column passed in as, rather than a default
  label string, which breaks if the column we are interested in is NOT label.
* Updated the data names to match new regex mask.
* Created a few more library functions and moved out functions as needed.
* Bugfix: Confusion matrix didn't print pred or true before.
* Bugfix: Selecting the right columns for svm, was a position. Now
  selects from the column given.

## 0.4.0.0 [02-03-2014] #
* Failed to update version numbers correctly on files.
* Added extra check to see if the column we select from the file
  doesn't exist.
* Added extra comments and broke powerAnalyze.r into two files for
  easier reading.
* For the working directory, we move back to the default once we process
  the data.
* For the model, the data is split by a percentage now.

# 0.3.0.0 [01-30-2014] #
* Base data added.
* SVM working and printing confusion matrix.
* Bugfix: Main now creates a data.frame and not matrix.
* SVM module working.
* Simplified matrix creation call.
* Added label to process vector.
* Used closure to remove global counter.

* BUgfix: Extra information in trace name.
* Bugfix: Removing extra print for extra table.

# 0.2.0.0 [01-28-2014] #
* List is now an acceptable data format for the SVM.
* Reading multiple data and returning a labeled list.
* Organized folder hierarchy.
* Added outline of SVM function.
* Summary function implemented in chain.
* Tested initial r script.
* Created make script to automate running r.

# 0.1.0.0 [01-24-2014] #
